Setting up Sphinx with ABlog
==========

Having a folder to keep track of code snippets really helped when I was
learning Python, but now that I'm doing extra development for coursework as
well as projects it's hard to keep it all in one place. A website was clearly
the way to go, and it needed to have timestamped posts with editable tags,
search functionality and the potential for easy expansion.

After some searching and prototyping with GitHub pages I've settled on
`ABlog <http://ablog.readthedocs.io/manual/ablog-quick-start/>`,
an easy-to-use front-end for Sphinx that takes all the publishing and markup
functionality and adds in blog-style features including easy deployment to GitHub.

Getting it set up was easy by following the quick start guide followed by
`This page <http://ablog.readthedocs.io/manual/deploy-to-github-pages/>`_, which
required adding an environment variable for my GitHub token so it would
stop asking for my password. In the .bashrc file under /home/user, add this line:
``export GITHUB_TOKEN="<token>"``

Then to deploy the site to GitHub, we run this from the project directory:

``ablog build
ablog serve  # Not always necessary
ablog deploy --github-token GITHUB_TOKEN``
