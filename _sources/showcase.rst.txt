The following series of diagrams describe the processing of geospatial data including rain and stream gauges, settlements, watercourses and algorithmically-generated catchments in order to estimate settlement risk based on the characteristics of the upstream catchment.
  *Software: ESRI ArcGIS, Python.*

**Rain gauge distribution and density relative to the catchment upstream of a settlement:**
