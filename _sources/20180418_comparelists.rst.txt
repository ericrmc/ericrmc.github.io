Comparing lists
===============

Comparing the contents of two lists can be done by using sets, but in the case both lists are ordered and are the same length there is a better approach. If we want to compare the ith item of each list together, we can use the ``zip()`` method::

    # Two lists k and j:
    j = ['6.77','6.77','a']
    k = ['8.02','6.77','a']

``zip(j,k)`` will create a list with the ordered pairs, and we can use list comprehension to find the differences::

    [x for x in zip(j,k) if x[0]<>x[1]]

An extension of this might be to compare the values between a master table and an update table which contains modified values in some unknown attributes. Given our two tables and a list of fields, we can show which records have different values. (There is no primary key between each table, but attributes with indices 0 and 4 can be used as a pair)::

    with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(tbl_update, fields) as srows:
        for i, srow in enumerate(srows):
            sql_where = "Key1 = '{}' and Key2 = {}".format(srow[0], srow[4])
            with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(tbl_master, fields, sql_where) as mrows:
                for mrow in mrows:
                    print('Record {}, {} changes.'
                        .format(str(i + 1),
                        len([x for x in zip(srow,mrow) if x[0]<>x[1]]))
                    )

Removing the ``len()`` part would show the old and new value pairs. A useful extension of this would be to report the field names, too.
