About ericrmc
============================

I've created this site as a simple way to save and retrieve code snippets for
my personal use, as well as showcase some things I've worked on in a shareable
way.

I'm based in Australia and use Python for spatial data processing and mapping.
I have invested in learning about data science so have starting using additional
modules for data mining and integration. I have also started using R for
analysing and visualising my work. I find that setting all the environments up
can be a task in itself so some material will just be notes on those processes.
