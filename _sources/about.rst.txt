About this site
============================

I've created this site as a simple way to save and retrieve development notes
and code snippets, as well as showcase some things I've worked on in a shareable way.

I'm based in Australia and use Python for spatial data processing and mapping.
I have invested in learning about data science so have starting using additional
modules for data mining, integration, and machine learning.
I am also using R for statistically analysing and visualising my work.
I find that setting all the environments up
can be a task in itself so some material will just be notes on those processes.
