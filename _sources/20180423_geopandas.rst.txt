GeoPandas for geospatial data in Python
=======================================

GeoPandas is a project that started in 2013 and incorporates some of the most useful geospatial data processing
packages available in Python. It's very comprehensive but a bit on the slow side because it stores custom Python objects in arrays,
so for operations it has to iterate through those objects. Some recent enhancements with Cython means it's closing the gap to
bigger open-source tools like PostGIS.

Some major features:

- Read and write a variety of formats (fiona, GDAL/OGR)
- Familiar manipulation of the attributes (pandas dataframe)
- Element-wise spatial predicates (intersects, within, ...) and operations (intersection, union, difference, ...) (shapely)
- Re-project your data (pyproj)
- Quickly visualise the geometries (matplotlib, descartes)
- More advanced spatial operations: spatial joins and overlays (rtree)

It can be expanded with the following packages:

- geoplot for visualisation and cartopy for projection-aware cartography
- folium for Leaflet.js maps, including easy OpenStreetMap API plugins
- OSMnx for street networks
- PySAL for geospatial analysis
- rasterio for working with raster data

The official site is `<http://geopandas.org/index.html>`_. The Cython branch is available through GitHub:

- clone https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas
- checkout 'geopandas-cython' branch
- ``make inplace``

An alternative is GeoAlchemy 2, which extends SQLAlchemy for working with spatial databases and focuses on PostGIS.
